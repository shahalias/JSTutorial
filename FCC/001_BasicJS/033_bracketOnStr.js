// Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

/* 
For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
 */

// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
