// Use Conditional Logic with If Statements

// if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
    // Only change code below this line
    if (wasThatTrue) {
      return "Yes, that was true";
    }
    else {
      return "No, that was false";
    }
  
  
    // Only change code above this line
  
  }
