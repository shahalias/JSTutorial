// Restrict Possible Usernames

// Usernames are used everywhere on the internet. They are what give users a unique identity on their favorite sites.

// You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

// Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

// The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

// Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

// Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

// Change the regex userCheck to fit the constraints listed above.

let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
let userCheck = /^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|^[a-z]\d\d+$/i; // Change this line
let result = userCheck.test(username);

// Code Explanation
// ^ - start of input
// [a-z] - first character is a letter
// [a-z]+ - following characters are letters
// \d*$ - input ends with 0 or more digits
// | - or
// ^[a-z] - first character is a letter
// \d\d+ - following characters are 2 or more digits
// $ - end of input

let username1 = "JackOfAllTrades";
const userCheck1 = /^[a-z]([0-9]{2,}|[a-z]+\d*)$/i;
let result1 = userCheck1.test(username1);

// Code Explanation
// ^ - start of input
// [a-z] - first character is a letter
// [0-9]{2,} - ends with two or more numbers
// | - or
// [a-z]+ - has one or more letters next
// \d* - and ends with zero or more numbers
// $ - end of input
// i - ignore case of input
