// Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

// What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

// const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
