// Build JavaScript Objects

// Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

const myDog = {
    // Only change code below this line
    "name": "Rover",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ['Ali','Abu']

    // Only change code above this line
};
